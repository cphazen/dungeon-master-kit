# Setting for Children of the Village

## The World

It is a typical fantasy world with a modern flair.

Dwarfs, Dragons, and Demons, though not all common all exist and are well known.

However, the modern twist of tourist traps, interstate bypasses and Southern stereotypes.

## Town of Filorum

It is a medium sized town, around two thousand people, primarily human. Within the region of Furati.  
The high walls provide protection and shadow over the city. The buildings are older, but maintained. The stone roads seem to be worn with travel.

However, the few people you see on the street are quiet. The big open market place is only occupied by small groups talking or by people walking with purpose.

It is located on the south side of a huge lake. The North side is a mountain. Trade and other traffic used to go through the town, but more recently a bridge was constructed over the lake that most people use to by pass the town.  

(Filiorum means child in Latin, Furati means stolen in Latin)

### Places of Interest

#### General Store

Plain old store. Shelves of various items. Doesn't sell anything out of the ordinary. With very little of note, except that the owners live in an attached house.

#### Main Entrance/Marketplace

Old stone plaza. Contains many unoccupied market stalls. Ian's Impressive Inn is located on the East side, while the general store is on the West. The surrounding area is primarily residential with two pathways out of the South East and South West. The South East also contains the School building and most the younger families. The Town Hall is visible directly South. The Gate is on the North side with a few guard post along the wall.

#### Ian's Impressive Inn

It's the only building with a recent coat of paint. And a bright sign on top. There is also a big porch out front, which is odd for this sort of building. The inside is very well put together, with matching decor and Ian's Impressive Inn written everywhere. It also has a gift shop with undead miniatures, mugs, art and everything else.

#### School

It's a small building with enough room for about twenty students. Desk are neatly organized, and there are many books. Kind of like old west one room school.

#### Town Hall

Located inside a repurposed cathedral. It's one of the biggest buildings in the town. It has many underground areas, partly to for old crypts, but also cells and other rooms. There is an old outside entrance, but that is dilapidated. Most officials go down the inside stair cases.
